-Insurance Charge Linear Regression Problem:

This project includes the processes of Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis, Regression model training, and model evaluation.
This project also serves as one of the first examples of data analytics that I have extensively done to this extent, as a student.

The dataset 'insurance.csv' was used in this project and initially had data of the 'dicrete', 'categorical', and 'continuous' types prior to data preprocessing.

This project involved the fiting and evaluation of linear and Lasso type regression models.
